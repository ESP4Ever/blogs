# ros2 software package for Intel® RealSense™ devices

## Overview
The ``realsense-ros`` publishes image data and IMU data of D430i as topics through ROS2.
The supported librealsense version currently is v2.50.0 (refer to the [realsense2_camera release notes](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros/releases))。
On the basis of the realsense-ros source code, functions such as power-on self-check, alternating pattern projection data publication, depth map alignment to other modules, and ROS2 lifecycle state machine have been added.

## /camera/camera node
 - Function: Provides binocular and IMU data for localization and mapping, and provides depth data for navigation and obstacle avoidance functions
 - Publishes data contents
   - Publish left and right image data
   - Publish depth data
   - Publish IMU data

  - ``rosbag_filename``：Publishes topics through ros2 bag.
  - ``initial_reset``：Sometimes, the device may not have been properly closed and requires resetting due to firmware issues.
  - ``wait_for_device_timeout``：The time to wait when the specified device is not detected.
  - ``reconnect_timeout``：The time to wait before reconnecting when the driver cannot detect the USB device.


## /camera/camera_align node
 - Function: Aligns the depth information from Realsense to the AI camera module, providing depth information for visual tracking.
 - Published data contents:
   - Publishes left and right eye data (optional).
   - Publishes depth data.
   - Publishes IMU data.
   - Publishes depth data aligned to the AI camera.

### Align algorithm framework

![align_algorithm](./image/realsense-ros/align_algorithm.png)

The alignment algorithm takes Realsense's depth frame and the AI camera's color frame as input and outputs the aligned depth map to the AI camera.
